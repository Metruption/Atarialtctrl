# Atarialtctrl

A python library to control an atari2600 using a raspberry pi.



### FAQ:

**Why?**

Because I want to.

### Dependencies:

* Python (coded on 2.7 because that's what my rpi's default python was, it better also work on 3)

* `evdev` python package

* `RPi.GPIO` python package

### How to use:

run `run.sh`

Press buttons on your controllers to bind in this order to the left joystick on the atari:

DOWN LEFT RIGHT FIRE UP

Repeat that order for the second joystick.
